# 👋 Hi, I'm Samarth Malgave

A MECHANICAL ENGINEER with a keen interest in design, FEA analysis, and industrial engineering. I like working on the details, especially in QA and QC, to make sure everything's running smoothly. Right now, I'm also getting into PROGRAMMING, which has been a cool addition to my skill set and will definitely help me tackle some challenging projects down the line. I’m always looking to improve and take on new tech-driven projects where I can make a real impact.
